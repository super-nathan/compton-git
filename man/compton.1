.SH DESCRIPTION
.B compton
is a compositor based on Dana Jansens' version of xcompmgr (which itself was
written by Keith Packard). It includes many improvements over the original
xcompmgr, including window frame opacity, inactive window transparency,
and shadows on argb windows.

.BI Format\ of\ a\ condition:

condition = <target>:<type>[<flags>]:<pattern>

<target> is one of "n" (window name), "i" (window class
instance), and "g" (window general class)

<type> is one of "e" (exact match), "a" (match anywhere),
"s" (match from start), "w" (wildcard), and "p" (PCRE
regular expressions, if compiled with the support).

<flags> could be a series of flags. Currently the only defined
flag is "i" (ignore case).

<pattern> is the actual pattern string.

.SH CONFIGURATION
(A more robust sample configuration file exists in the compton
repository.)

.B Example

.B ~/compton.conf:

    # Shadows
    shadow = true;

    # Opacity
    inactive-opacity = 0.8;
    frame-opacity = 0.7;

    # Fades
    fading = true;

.B Run with:

    $ compton --config ~/compton.conf
